&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after the 911 emergency number became available, an elderly and quite ill lady appeared in a hospital emergency room, having driven herself to the hospital and barely managing to stagger in from the parking lot. 
The horrified nurse said, "Why didn't you call the 911 number and get an ambulance?"
The lady said, "My phone doesn't have an eleven."

      <b>THE YOUNG BUSINESSMAN </b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A young businessman had just started his own firm. He rented a beautiful office and had it furnished with antiques. Sitting there, he saw a man come into the outer office. Wishing to appear the hot shot, the businessman picked up the phone and started to pretend he had a big deal working. 
He threw huge figures around and made giant commitments. Finally he hung up and asked the visitor, "Can I help you?" 
The man said, "Yeah, I've come to activate your phone lines."

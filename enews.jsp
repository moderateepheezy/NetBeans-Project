      &nbsp;&nbsp;The University Grants Commission (UGC) has decided to prepare an action
plan to bring 15,000 colleges under the UGC eligibility criteria fro Central assistance.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; This step was initiated after several colleges found it difficult to spend around Rs.2 lakhs
fro getting accreditation from the NAAC. Earlier, these benefits were given only to the universities.  The Commission had allocated Rs. 5 lakhs per 
university for getting accredited by the NAAC.

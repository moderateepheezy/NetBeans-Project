<b>A MANAGER'S DILEMA </b><br/>
An office manager had money problems and had to fire an employee, either Jack or Jill. He thought he'd fire the employee who came late to work the next morning 
<br/>
Well, both employees came to work very early. Then the manager thought he would catch the first one who took a coffee break. Unfortunately, neither employee took a coffee break. Then the manager decided to see who took the longest lunch break - strangely, neither Jack nor Jill took a lunch break that day, they both ate at their desk. Then the manager thought he'd wait and see who would leave work the earliest and both employees stayed after closing. <br/>
Jill finally went to the coat rack and the manager went up to her ands said, 
"Jill, I have a terrible problem. I don't know whether to lay you or Jack off." Jill said
"Well, you'd better jack off, because I'm late for my bus."

<b>Words written on butterflies</b><br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>by Amir Saleem</i><br/><br/>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;Tanya got out of the bed while the sun was still asleep. She looked out the window; even the stars were lost in the dark. "Would I be able to watch sunrise today?" she asked her heart. She knew the answer but was afraid to tell herself. Mike, her husband was still in bed and so were her four kids. Even their sleep couldn't elude her from doing them service. She had to orchestrate her work to the microscopic details. From pressing clothes to polishing shoes, finding matching socks to arranging school bags, fixing up breakfast to preparing snack-boxes, she was unthankfully supposed to make it all happen like a magic wand. And to her own compulsory fault, she did it all; like a magic wand.<br/>
Life ran like a wheel. The circle started every morning and ended up late in the night, and then morning appeared again. There was no pause, no rest, not even a slight curve to insert change. She condemned herself for not experiencing even a thought of ever getting out of this circle. She had committed herself to the orbit of life.<br/>
Coming out of the bathroom, she turned and looked at her bushed face in the mirror and gasped a tired answer to her long asked question, "Never, you just keep driving in the sunset." She shook her head to wing away those rebellious butterflies in her mind. She knew she couldn't join them so she didn't want them to hang around her either.

        <p><b>Ninja Weapons </b><br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Imai dropped soundlessly from the tree limb onto the roof just as he had done so many times in the past few weeks. This night it was more difficult, because the rains and clouds, which had covered his movements before, were gone. The sky was clear and brightly lit by a full moon. He had to make use of every shadow. Without the howl of wind and the patter of rain he was also forced to move with extreme stealth and care so as to make no noise.<br/>
He was a Ninja, trained for such work. His shadowy form, wrapped in black cloth from head to foot, moved like a phantom from one patch of darkness to another. His many weapons and special devices were concealed and secured, silent, but accessible at any time.<br/>

Below him in the courtyard, the guards milled about, seemingly oblivious to his movements, wrapped up in the monotony of their tasks. As usual, a few of them by the walls were sleeping at their posts.<br/>

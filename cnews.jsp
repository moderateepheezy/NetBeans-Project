      &nbsp;&nbsp;Research team in Austria has been 
unravelling the secrets of the charging of plastic foams.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Its findings 
open the way for the development of flat microphones and loudspeakers, 
as well as 'smart'surfaces that could be used as floor coverings, 
among other things
